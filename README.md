# 🧠 Smart Price Optimization using XGBoost

This is a machine learning-powered web app built with Streamlit that helps optimize product pricing based on historical data. It leverages XGBoost for regression modeling and provides an interactive dashboard to visualize pricing insights, explore trends, and make custom predictions. The goal of this project is to assist businesses in setting smarter prices by combining data-driven analysis with an easy-to-use interface.

## 🚀 Features

- Load and clean pricing dataset (`retail_price.csv`)
- Encode categorical features with one-hot encoding
- Train and evaluate an XGBoost Regressor model
- Display model performance metrics: RMSE and R²
- Visualize feature importance
- Identify top 5 price optimization opportunities
- Custom input form for price prediction
- Save trained model with Joblib

---

## 📁 Dataset Format

Place `retail_price.csv` in the root project directory. It should contain:
- `unit_price` (target variable)
- `product_id`, `month_year`, `product_category_name` (feature columns)
- Other numerical and categorical features

---

## 📦 Requirements

Install required libraries using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn xgboost joblib streamlit scikit-learn
```
Or create a requirements.txt and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
🧪 Model Overview
Algorithm: XGBoost Regressor

Objective: Predict unit prices based on product features

Metrics: RMSE and R² Score

Train/Test Split: 80% train / 20% test


🎯 Streamlit Dashboard
View data preview in table format

See RMSE and R² score in metric cards

Visualize feature importances with bar plot

Predict price for custom inputs using sidebar form

Display top 5 predictions with largest positive delta (underpricing)

💻 How to Run
Run the app with:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
Make sure your dataset is placed correctly and all libraries are installed.


🔐 Saving the Model
The trained model is saved as:

```bash
xgboost_price_model.pkl
```
You can reload it later to make predictions without retraining.
